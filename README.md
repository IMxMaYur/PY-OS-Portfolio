# Mayur Giri Portfolio

Welcome to the **Mayur Giri Portfolio** — a modern, fast, and secure personal portfolio website built using **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**.

This portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer while implementing industry-standard security practices to protect both users and the application.

✔ Strong **security headers** implemented (HSTS, CSP, COOP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)  
✔ **Code obfuscation** and **source map disabling** to make source code harder to reverse-engineer  
✔ Configured for **Vercel deployment** with HTTPS enforced  
✔ Privacy-first settings with restricted permissions and strict referrer policies  
✔ SEO optimized and fast performance

## 🔐 Security Measures Implemented

This portfolio takes security seriously and includes the following measures:

### HTTP Headers
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):** Forces HTTPS connections for secure communication
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** Restricts where scripts and styles can be loaded from
- **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP):** Isolates pages from cross-origin attacks
- **X-Frame-Options:** Prevents clickjacking by disallowing the site from being embedded in iframes
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Stops browsers from MIME-sniffing content types
- **Referrer-Policy:** Controls how referrer data is sent to other sites to enhance privacy
- **Permissions-Policy:** Disables access to sensitive browser APIs like geolocation, camera, and microphone

### Code Protection
- **Obfuscation:** JavaScript code is transformed to make it harder to read
- **Source Maps Disabled:** Prevents exposing original source files in production
- **Minimal External Resource Loading:** All scripts and styles are restricted to trusted sources
- **No sensitive data stored in client-side code**

⚠ Note: Complete protection from code inspection is not possible on the web. These measures aim to deter casual code scraping and unauthorized reuse while maintaining user experience.
